// Brand layer. SUBPLOT and Wordie are the same machine wearing different clothes: one
// codebase, one pipeline, one set of bug fixes. What differs is the name, the voice, the
// palette, the type, and - the real difference - who is allowed to publish.
//
//   subplot  curated. A closed list of approved creators, entertainment only.
//   wordie   open. Any YouTuber can apply, proves the channel by OAuth, then passes
//            automatic checks and a human yes before anything of theirs publishes.
//
// The brand is resolved from the request host. A Node serverless instance handles one
// request at a time, so a module-level "active" brand is safe here; nothing below may hold
// on to it across an await boundary that could span requests.
//
// RULE: nothing outside this file may hardcode a brand name, a member word, an address or a
// domain. Use the helpers below. Everything here is per-brand or it is a bug.
